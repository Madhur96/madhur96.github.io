### Suggestions
1. Food - Yeah, vegetarians can face a little food problem. Carry ready to eat food from Halidram. Non-vegetarians can explore a lot in food! Glove app is good for food delivery.
2. Stay - I stayed at [Wanderlust Hostel Riverside](https://www.booking.com/Share-04o6YYv). It's located at a very convenient place to expore the city and is very calm locality. Checkout properties nearby this area.
3. Commute - Download Yandex Taxi App.
4. Maps - Yandex App.
5. Bus - Yandex App. Get a bus pass from any local store. DO NOT sit in bus without a pass.
