### Suggestions
1. Keep Hoodie - When travelling in Winters, it gets cold while returning from outskirts of Jaipur at night.
2. Stay - I stayed at [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/949630240212661410). It's located at a very convenient place to expore the city. To save on airbnb taxes, you can get owner's contact from me.
3. Commute - Rent scooty from: Royal Brothers/ Onn Bike/ Joy Rides (check the one nearest to your stay). Avoid cabs as it get crowded around the old city.

This itinerary is ideal because:
- Minimal Commute Time: It groups nearby attractions together for efficient exploration.
- Tried and Tested: I personally followed this plan and refined it based on my experience.
- Optimal Timing for Views: Each place is scheduled to align with its key attractions. For instance, _Nahargarh Fort_ offers the best experience during the day, so it’s planned for the morning, while _Chokhi Dhani_ shines in the evening, making it a perfect way to end the day.
