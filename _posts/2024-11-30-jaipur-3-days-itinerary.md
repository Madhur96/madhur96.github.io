- Tried and Tested: I personally followed this plan and refined it based on my experience.
- Optimal Timing for Views: Each place is scheduled to align with its key attractions. For instance, _Nahargarh Fort_ offers the best experience during the day, so it’s planned for the morning, while _Chokhi Dhani_ shines in the evening, making it a perfect way to end the day.
