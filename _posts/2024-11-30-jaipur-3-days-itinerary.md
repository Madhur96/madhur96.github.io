### Suggestions
1. Keep Hoodie - When travelling in Winters, it gets cold while returning from outskirts of Jaipur at night.
2. Stay - I stayed at [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/949630240212661410). It's located at a very convenient place to expore the city and is very calm locality. Checkout properties nearby this area.
3. Commute - Rent scooty from: Royal Brothers/ Onn Bike/ Joy Rides (check the one nearest to your stay). Avoid cabs as it gets crowded around the old city.
